Also we needed to do some research on the data because all of us are not really formiliar with the financial sector 
First we analyze the data we got. We found out that the ebit, total liabilities, net added value, staff costs and off course the current revenue are the most important values

We tested different models and we had the best results with XGBoost. It is also one of the strongest ML models available.
